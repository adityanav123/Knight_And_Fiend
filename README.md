## The Story

In the grim game you play as the knight, your fate teeters on a precarious balance. If you manage to ensnare the fiend before all your precious potion plants succumb to destruction, victory is yours—the fiend lies vanquished by your hand. However, should the fiend ravage and obliterate every last plant, your toil and efforts amount to naught. The fiend claims triumph, seizing all you've strived for, and your once-potent weapon vanishes into the ether, leaving you empty-handed and bereft. Your destiny hinges on the survival of your potion plants—will you emerge victorious, or shall the fiend revel in its devastating conquest?
